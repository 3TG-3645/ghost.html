<h1 class="title">THE SLIM SHADY LP (SSLP) - 1999</h1>

<img class="cover" src="images/TSSLP.jpeg" alt="The Slim Shady LP cover">

<p class="text">
    The Slim Shady LP is the second studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on February 23, 1999, by Aftermath Entertainment and
    Interscope Records. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production
    from Dr. Dre, Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Featuring West Coast hip hop, G-funk and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LP's lyrical content is written from the
    perspective of Eminem's alter ego, named Slim Shady, whom he created on the Slim Shady EP (1997). The Slim Shady LP contains cartoonish depictions
     of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem described as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of
      the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The Slim Shady LP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC's FanMail, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It
    received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and eccentric personality.
    The first single, "My Name Is", became Eminem's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at the 2000 Grammy Awards, while
    "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, The Slim Shady LP was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of
    America (RIAA).
</p>

<p class="text">
    While The Slim Shady LP's success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure
    due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth. Despite this, the album has since been
    included in several publications' lists of the greatest albums of all time.

<h1 class="title">THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP (MMLP) - 2000</h1>

<img class="cover" src="images/MMLP.jpg" alt="The Marshall Mathers LP cover">

<p class="text">
    The Marshall Mathers LP is the third studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment and
    Interscope Records. The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and Eminem, along with The 45 King, the Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man. Recorded over a
    two-month period in several studios around Detroit, the album features more introspective lyricism, including Eminem's thoughts on his rise from
    rags to riches, the criticism of his music, and his estrangement from his family and wife. A transgressive work, it incorporates horrorcore and
    hardcore hip hop, while also featuring satirical songs. Featured appearances include Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Bizarre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit,
    Nate Dogg, and D12.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Like its predecessor, The Marshall Mathers LP was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release, while also propelling Eminem to the
    forefront of American pop culture. Criticism centered on lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, misogynistic, as well as the reference
    to the Columbine High School massacre. Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, while the Canadian government
    considered refusing Eminem's entry into the country. Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised Eminem's
    lyrical ability and considered the album to have emotional depth.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, staying atop for eight consecutive weeks. A significant commercial success compared
    to the release of The Slim Shady LP just the previous year, the album sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it among the
    fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album produced the singles "The Real Slim Shady", "The Way I Am", "Stan", "I'm Back"
    and "Bitch Please II". Among other publications, Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2000.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The Marshall Mathers LP has been included in several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem's best album.
    It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time, and is certified 11× platinum by the Recording
    Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while
    "The Real Slim Shady" won Best Rap Solo Performance.

<h1 class="title">The Eminem Show (TES) - 2002</h1>

<img class="cover" src="images/TES.jpg" alt="The Eminem Show Cover">

<p class="text">The Eminem Show is the fourth studio album by American rapper Eminem. After it had originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002, the album was released on May 26, 2002, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records due to pirating and bootlegging of it. The album saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass, and Dr. Dre being the album's executive producer. It features guest appearances from Obie Trice, D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Dina Rae and Eminem's daughter<abbr title="Eminem's daughter"> Hailie Jade Scott-Mathers</abbr>.</p>

<p class="text">The album incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem's previous albums, and its themes are predominantly based on Eminem's prominence in hip hop culture, as well as his ambivalent thoughts of fame. The album also features political commentary on the United States, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the War on terror, President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, The Eminem Show was regarded as Eminem's most personal album at the time and a step back from the Slim Shady alter ego.</p>

<p class="text">Widely considered the most anticipated album of 2002, The Eminem Show debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and stood there for six non-consecutive weeks. It sold over 1.3 million copies in its second week in the US, where it registered a full week of sales. It also topped the UK Albums Chart for five consecutive weeks. It produced four commercially successful singles, "Without Me", "Cleanin' Out My Closet", "Superman", and "Sing for the Moment", and it features one of his most popular songs, "'Till I Collapse". The album was met with positive critical reviews, with praise directed at Eminem's mature, introspective lyricism and the album's experimental production.</p>

<p class="text">The Eminem Show was both the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States and the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. In 2022, it was certified 12× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its worldwide sales of 27 million copies make it one of the best-selling albums of all time and the second best-selling album of the 21st century. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album, while "Without Me" won Best Music Video. Blender, Muzik and LAUNCH named it the best album of 2002, and several publications named it among the best albums of the 2000s decade. </p>

<h1 class="title">Encore (2004)</h1>

<img class="cover" src="images/encore.jpg" alt="Encore cover">

<p class="text">Encore (stylized as ƎNCORE) is the fifth studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on November 12, 2004, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. Its release date was originally set for November 17, 2004, but Eminem moved the release date to five days earlier after the album was leaked to the internet. As reflected on the album cover—Eminem taking a bow—the album was widely considered to be Eminem's final album of new material.</p>

<p class="text">The album contains several lyrical themes, most notably Eminem's opposition to then-President of the United States George W. Bush and a parody towards Michael Jackson. The album features more comedic themes and lyrics than Eminem's previous albums.</p>

<p class="text">Critical reception of Encore was less favorable than Eminem's previous albums, with most of the second half being heavily criticized for its lackluster quality and lack of lyrical content, though "Mockingbird" and "Like Toy Soldiers" were particularly highly praised and retrospectively have been noted as being some of Eminem's best songs. The album has sold 11 million copies worldwide and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 17, 2004.</p>

<p class="text">Encore provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Jackson, who was upset about Eminem's depiction of him in the video for "Just Lose It". Retrospectively, the album is often considered to be one of Eminem's worst albums alongside Revival.</p>

<p class="reminder">
    during this period from 2004 to 2009, Eminem was gone. everyone was wondering whether he'd be back and the death of his close friend Proof in
    2006 helped rumours that he wouldn't come back onstage. he was too addicted to drugs, all the signs were showing that Eminem was done.
</p>

<h1 class="title">Relapse - 2009</h1>

<img class="cover" src="images/Relapse.jpg" alt="Relapse cover">

<p class="text">
    Relapse (stylized as RELAPSƎ) is the sixth studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on May 19, 2009, through Aftermath Entertainment,
    Shady Records, and Interscope Records. It was his first album of original material since Encore (2004), following a four-year hiatus from recording
    due to his writer's block and an addiction to prescription sleeping medication. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2008 to 2009
    at several recording studios, and Dr. Dre, Mark Batson, and Eminem handled production.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Relapse is a concept album that revolves around horror, drug rehabilitation and relapse. A return of his Slim Shady alter ego, Eminem stated that
    the album's theme was more reminiscent of The Slim Shady LP (1999) and The Marshall Mathers LP (2000). In September 2007, Dr. Dre stated his
    intention to dedicate two months to the production of the album. Working with Dr. Dre allowed Eminem to pick the beats from Dr. Dre's catalog that
    challenged his rhythm to experiment with different flows. During the recording period, a handful of songs intended for Relapse were leaked on
    the Internet.
</p>

<p class="text">
    One of the most anticipated albums of 2009, Relapse debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 608,000 copies in its first week. It also
    reached number one in twelve other countries. It produced four singles: "Crack a Bottle", "We Made You", "3 a.m.", and "Beautiful", as well as the
    promotional single: "Old Time's Sake". "Crack a Bottle", featuring Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Relapse was
    certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
</p>

<p class="text">
    Critically, the album received mixed reviews. Reviewers generally praised its production, but were divided in their responses towards the writing
    and overuse of accents throughout the album. Nonetheless, it won Eminem the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, while "Crack a Bottle" won for Best Rap
    Performance by a Duo or Group. The album later found a strong cult following among Eminem's fans and critics, establishing Relapse as a cult
    classic.

<img class="cover" src="images/MMLP2.jpg" alt="the marshall mathers lp 2 cover"></img>

<p class="text">The Marshall Mathers LP 2 is the eighth studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on November 5, 2013 by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. The album is Eminem's last to have the involvement of independent label Web Entertainment. It serves as a sequel to his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000).

It features guest appearances from Skylar Grey, Rihanna, Nate Ruess, and rapper Kendrick Lamar, among others.</p>

<p class="text">The idea of a sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP came about after Eminem recorded a handful of songs in the early stages of the creation of the album that reminded him of his earlier music, though Eminem wanted to experiment with "retro, vintage" sounds from turntablism for the sequel. The album draws influences from arena rock and old-school hip hop, mainly inspired by the Beastie Boys' Licensed to Ill era and LL Cool J's Radio era, while the production is more minimalist than Eminem's previous records.</p>

<p class="text">The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was regarded as one of the most anticipated albums of 2013. The album was revealed during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards in August 2013, alongside a preview of its lead single "Berzerk". It was followed by two more singles: "Survival" and "Rap God". "The Monster", featuring Rihanna, was released as the album's fourth single and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's fifth single "Headlights", featuring Ruess, was released in 2014.</p>

<p class="text">The Marshall Mathers LP 2 debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling more than 792,000 copies in its first week. In March 2017, it was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was met with positive reviews by critics, with praise directed at Eminem's technical rapping abilities and production choices. The album marked an improvement in a reception over Eminem's previous three albums, and was named on multiple best album year-end lists. It won Eminem a record sixth Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 2015 Grammy Awards.</p>

<h1 class="title">KAMIKAZE - 2018</h1>

<img class="cover" src="images/Kamikaze.jpg" alt="kamikaze cover">

<p class="text">
    Kamikaze (stylized as KAMIKAZƎ) is the tenth studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on August 31, 2018, through Aftermath Entertainment,
    Shady Records, and Interscope Records, and without prior announcement. The album features guest appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9", Jessie Reyez,
    and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon. Eminem, credited as Slim Shady, and Dr. Dre served as executive producers, while production for individual
    tracks comes from a variety of musicians.
</p>
<p class="text">
    Following the polarizing reception of his previous album, Revival (2017), music journalists debated over whether the rapper's relevance and ability
    were waning. In response to the criticism, Eminem released a remix of the song "Chloraseptic" in January 2018 with 2 Chainz and Phresher. Kamikaze
    represents a continuation of this response, containing various insults against critics and rappers alike. The artwork is an homage to Beastie Boys'
    debut album, Licensed to Ill (1986).
</p>
<p class="text">
    Kamikaze received generally favorable reviews from critics. Some praised it as an improvement over the rapper's
    previous album and a welcome return to the sound of his earlier, more aggressive material, while others criticized its lack of adaption to the
    current sound of hip hop, and as a result, found it outdated. The album also generated some controversy for its diss tracks about various artists,
    as well as spurring accusations of homophobia.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The album was promoted with three singles: "Fall", "Venom", from the 2018 movie of the same name, and "Lucky You", and a music
    video for "Good Guy", along with a supporting tour. Commercially, the album reached number one in 18 countries, becoming Eminem's ninth
    consecutive number-one album in the United States, and later becoming the best-selling hip-hop album of 2018. It later received platinum
    certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

<img class="cover" src="images/Music to be Murdered By Side B.jpg" alt="mtbmb side b cover">

<p class="text">
    On December 18, 2020, a deluxe edition of the album, titled Music to Be Murdered By - Side B, was released. It is a Side B version to the album.
    Similar to Eminem's previous two albums, it was released without any prior announcement. It contains a bonus disc with sixteen new tracks, with
    guest appearances by Skylar Grey, DJ Premier, Ty Dolla $ign, Dr. Dre, Sly Pyper, MAJ, and White Gold. The album's release was accompanied
    by a music video for "Gnat", directed by Cole Bennett. The music video for "Higher" premiered on January 23, 2021. Lyric videos for
    "Tone Deaf" and "Alfred's Theme" were also released.In May 2021, a remix of "Killer", featuring Jack Harlow and Cordae, was released.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The week the deluxe edition was released, the album saw a 1,125% boost in sale units from the previous week, moving 94,000 units. This brought
    the album back up to the 3rd spot on the Billboard 200 album chart in its 48th week, a 196 spot jump from the week previous, breaking a 50-year-old
    Billboard 200 record previously held by Bob Dylan with Self Portrait (1970) which made a 193 spot jump.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Side B was met with generally positive reviews. Robert Christgau appraised the release as "more proof that Eminem loves rhyme as compulsively as
    MF DOOM himself", adding that, "If he's not as playful or surreal about it as Doom, he sure does enunciate better, with a timbral dexterity never
    quashed by the rock-inflected production style that Dr. Dre laid on him decades ago and oversees here." While highlighting lyrics from
    "Alfred's Theme", "Tone Deaf", "Black Magic", and "These Demons" on Side B, he also observed "more braggadocio and less delight in these words for
    their own sake than in the Side A's".
